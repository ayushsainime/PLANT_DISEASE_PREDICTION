Key Features:
- CNN-based image classification
- 38-class disease detection
- High accuracy model (~97%)
- Easy-to-follow Jupyter Notebook implementation

## üìÇ Dataset
The model uses the [PlantVillage dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/emmarex/plantdisease) from Kaggle containing thousands of images across:

- 38 different classes (diseases + healthy leaves)
- Multiple plant species
- Color images (256√ó256 pixels)

Dataset is downloaded and unzipped automatically using the Kaggle API in the notebook.

## üõ†Ô∏è Methodology
### CNN Architecture
Built using Keras with TensorFlow backend:

1. **Conv2D layers** - Feature extraction (edges, textures)
2. **MaxPooling2D layers** - Downsampling feature maps
3. **Flatten layer** - Converts 2D features to 1D vector
4. **Dense layers** - Final classification with softmax activation

### Training Configuration:
- Optimizer: Adam
- Loss Function: Categorical Crossentropy
- Metrics: Accuracy
- Epochs: 20
